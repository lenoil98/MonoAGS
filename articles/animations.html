<h1 id="animations">Animations</h1>

<p>An animation is composed out of a list of frames where each frame shows an image. The engine then runs through the images to make it look like the object is moving (i.e a walk animation, a talk animation, a jump animation, etc).</p>
<h2 id="animation-top-level-configuration">Animation top-level configuration</h2>
<p>An animation can be configured from the <code>IAnimationConfiguration</code> interface with the following properties:</p>
<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
<p>How many times an animation will loop before it stops?
Or, you can put 0 which will be interpreted as an endless animation (will loop over and over till the end of time, unless you manually stop it from the code).</p>
<h3 id="looping-style">Looping Style</h3>
<p>You can select how the animation will loop: forwards, backwards, forwards and then backwards, or backwards and then forwards.</p>
<h3 id="delay-between-frames">Delay Between Frames</h3>
<p>Gets or sets the delay between each frame.
The delay is measured in frames, so if we&#39;re running at the expected 60 FPS, a delay of 5 (the default) means each second 12 frames of animation will be shown.
Note that each frame can be configured with an additional delay. That delay will be added for this
overall delay for that specific frame, so a frame&#39;s delay is relative, while this delay can be used
as an overall speed for the entire animation.</p>
<h2 id="animation-per-frame-configuration">Animation per-frame configuration</h2>
<p>An animation frame is actually using a <code>ISprite</code> object, which wraps around an image and gives it a lot of the capabilities that objects have. So you can have a position, scale, rotation, pivot, tint and even a custom renderer for each frame individually (those properties will be relative to the object, so if you have a frame with a position of (10, 5) it means that the frame will be offset from the rest of the object/animations by 10 pixels to the right and 5 pixels to the bottom).</p>
<p>Also, for each image, you can configure how to render the texture:</p>
<h3 id="textures">Textures</h3>
<p>A texture is the 2D image asset which is rendered as the image. For each texture you can configure:</p>
<h4 id="scale-updown-filters">Scale Up/Down Filters</h4>
<p>The filters used to scale up/down (i.e stretch/shrink) the texture to fit the image (if the image size is bigger/smaller than the texture). <code>Linear</code> will smooth the pixels so it&#39;s recommended if your texture is not pixel-art. <code>Nearest</code> will use the nearest neighbor algorithm, this gives a more pixel-like look so it&#39;s recommended if your texture is pixel-art.</p>
<h4 id="wrap-horizontalvertical">Wrap Horizontal/Vertical</h4>
<p>How would the texture be wrapped to match the image on its horizontal/vertical axis.
The default is <code>Clamp</code>, the texture will be stretched to fit the image (using the scale up/down filters). Other options are <code>Repeat</code> and <code>MirroredRepeat</code> which will tile the texture and repeat it until fitting the image.</p>
<p>Additionally, the following properties can be set per frame:</p>
<h3 id="frame-delay">Frame Delay</h3>
<p>An animation frame has 2 modes of delays that you can choose from (how much time to wait before moving on to the next frame).
It&#39;s either a specific delay or a random delay with an allowed range.
A random delay with an allowed range is useful for simulating talking, for example, when the mouth 
is moving in random speeds, giving the illusion of actual talking, instead of repeating animation 
that breaks the illusion fast.</p>
<p>The delay is added on top of the animation&#39;s overall delay and measure in game ticks. So let&#39;s say we have an overall animation speed configured to be 5 (the default), and we have this frame delay configured to be also 5 (the default is 0) and the game is running with 60 FPS (frames per second- also the default), then the total delay for this frame will be 10 ticks, so it will run
for 1/6 of a second.</p>
<h3 id="sound-emitter">Sound Emitter</h3>
<p>A sound emitter can be attached to a frame, and assuming the emitter also has an audio clip attached to it, the audio clip will play when the frame is showing, from the apparent location the object is at (i.e by panning and adjusting volume, depending on how the sound emitter is configured).
This is especially useful for footsteps, for example.</p>
<p>Note that, for footsteps, for example, you&#39;d probably want to set the same emitter for all directions of walking which might be tedious. Luckily, the sound emitter has convenience method which you can use which will assign it to multiple animations at once.</p>
<h2 id="animation-state-control">Animation State Control</h2>
<p>You can query (and if needed, change) the state of an animation.
Here are the properties you can query/control at run-time:</p>
<h3 id="is-running-backwards">Is running backwards?</h3>
<p>Is the animation currently running forwards or backwards?</p>
<h3 id="current-frame">Current frame</h3>
<p>The current frame that is currently showing in the game. You can also access the sprite in that frame and change its properties while the game is running (like position, rotation, etc).</p>
<h3 id="current-loop">Current loop</h3>
<p>The current loop number that is running.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-next-frame">Time to next frame</h3>
<p>How much time (in game ticks: so 10 when the game is at 60FPS means 1/6 of a second) is left before the engine will move to the next frame.</p>
<h3 id="is-paused">Is Paused</h3>
<p>Pause/resume an animation (and query if it is paused or not).</p>
<h2 id="additional-building-commands">Additional Building Commands</h2>
<p>In addition, you can clone an animation (or an individual frame), and flip an animation horizontally/vertically for easily creating similar but different animations.</p>
<h2 id="directional-animations">Directional Animations</h2>
<p>Directional animations allow grouping animations for different directions together (for example, walking left and right). This is used by the character (using the <a href="characters.html#outfits">outfit</a>) when choosing a directional animation: if you don&#39;t assign all of the directions, the engine will attempt to choose the best direction based on what you have assigned. So, for example, if you only assign Left and Right animations for your walk animation, and the player is attempting to walk down-right, the engine will use the Right animation.</p>
<h2 id="tweens">Tweens</h2>
<p>Another form of animation is tweening (short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening">inbetweening</a>), which lets you interpolate values over time, which can be very useful for animating movements.</p>
<p>Built-in tweens exist for animating position/scale/rotation/pivot/color for objects/sprites/viewports, and also for animating volume/pitch for sounds:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">//Will move hero&#39;s x position to 100 in 5 seconds (linearly), without waiting for it to complete.
cHero.TweenX(100, 5); 

//Will rotate the hero to 120 degrees in 10 seconds, by using the bounce-in function, without waiting for it to complete
cHero.TweenAngle(120, 10, Ease.BounceIn); 

//Will fade-out the character in 1.5 seconds using the quad-out function and wait for it to complete.
await cHero.TweenOpacity(0, 1.5, Ease.QuadOut).Task;

//Will zoom in the camera to double the size, on both x and y at the same time (and wait for it to complete).
var tweenX = viewport.TweenScaleX(2, 5).Task;
var tweenY = viewport.TweenScaleY(2, 5).Task;
await Task.WhenAll(tweenX, tweenY);

//Will rotate the camera to 180 degrees for 3 seconds, then back to 0 degrees for another 3 seconds.
//At the same time will fade out the playing music, but just for 4 seconds. Then will wait for the first
//one to complete (so that would be the music).
var tweenCamera = viewport.TweenAngle(180, 3).Task.ContinueWith(t =&gt; viewport.TweenAngle(0, 3).Task);
var tweenMusic = music.TweenVolume(0, 4, Ease.SineIn).Task;
var completedTask = await Task.WhenAny(tweenCamera, tweenMusic);
if (completedTask == tweenMusic) {
    cHero.Say(&quot;This is the expected behavior, as the music clip took 4 seconds and the camera 6 seconds&quot;);
}
else cHero.Say(&quot;This can&#39;t happen!&quot;);

//Will start making the character darker, then pause it just 50 milliseconds after that, then resume it and wait for it.
var tweenDark = cHero.TweenLightness(0.5, 5);
await Task.Delay(50);
tweenDark.Stop(TweenCompletion.Pause);
await Task.Delay(50);
tweenDark.Resume();
await tweenDark.Task;
</code></pre><p>If a tween you need does not exist, then creating one is not difficult, as the <code>Tween.Run</code> method will let you tween any value that you want. 
Here is, for example, the one-liner function implementation for <code>TweenX</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">public static Tween TweenX(this ISprite sprite, float toX, float timeInSeconds, Func&lt;float, float&gt; easing = null)
{
    return Tween.Run(sprite.X, toX, x =&gt; sprite.X = x, timeInSeconds, easing);
}
</code></pre></article>
